# Georgia Tech's CS 1332 - Data Structures & Algorithms (Fall 2021)
## Course Description
CS1332 provides an overview of basic data structures and algorithms on those structures. Searching, Sorting, linear, non-linear and randomized structures are covered. Students are expected to understand these structures and algorithms, to implement them in a programming language – but not to prove properties about them.
## Overview & Objectives
- Develop more skills in individual Java programming
- Work with common data structures used in software development by coding their low-level implementation
  - Arrays, ArrayLists,
  - LinkedLists (Singular, Doubly, Circular)
  - Stacks, Queues, Deques, Priority Queues
  - Various Trees: Binary, Binary Search, AVL, Splay, Heaps, 2-4 Trees, etc…
  - Hash Maps/Tables; External Chaining and Various Probing Techniques
  - Graphs and their Associated Algorithms
- Become familiar with common algorithms on these data structures
  - Sorting Algorithms: Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Cocktail Shaker, Merge, Quick, Radix etc...
  - Pattern Matching Algorithms: Brute force, Boyer-Moore, KMP, Rabin-Karp
  - Graph Algorithms: Dijkstra’s Shortest Path and multiple MSTs
  - Memoization & Dynamic Programming Approaches
- Work with Big-O notation, allowing good choices about the appropriate data structure and algorithm to use for a particular programming problem
- Improve one's ability to test and debug programs
